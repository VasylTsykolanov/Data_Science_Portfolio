# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio of Data Science projects.

A repository of the projects I worked on or currently working on. It is updated regularly. The projects are either written in R (R markdown) or Python (Jupyter Notebook). Click on the projects to see full analysis and code.
