# Data Science Portfolio

Hello :)
Welcome to my portfolio of Data Science projects.

A repository of the projects I worked on or currently working on. It is updated regularly. The projects are either written in Python or R. Click on the projects to see full analysis and code.

* Identified how product characteristics affect pricing (e.g. brand, condition, category of product, etc.)
* Performed data cleansing and enriched dataset based on several transformations of original features
* Identified the most important characteristics to recommend price
* Built machine learning models to recommend product price
* **Keywords**: Electronic products, pricing strategy, explanatory data analysis, random search, random forest



### [Product cannibalization & complementarity in retail](https://github.com/VasylTsykolanov/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Product%20cannibalization%20&%20complementarity%20in%20retail/readme.md)

* Identified product cannibalization and complementarity effects
* Quantified cannibalization effects between products by building new KPI - substitution score
* Built hierarchical models to group similar products into clusters by using only transactional data
* Built custom method to optimize the number of clusters
* **Keywords**: Retail, Product cannibalization, product complementarity, Apriori, Hierarchical clustering


### [Predictive modelling for marketing](https://github.com/VasylTsykolanov/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/Predictive%20modelling%20for%20marketing)
<img src="https://github.com/VasylTsykolanov/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Predictive%20modelling%20for%20marketing/images/cover.jpg" width="400">

* Used machine learning model (Hybrid Gradient Boosting) to predict customer acceptance of promotional campaign
* Data explore and outlier detection (IQR method and visualization)
* Identified and removed correlated features based on mixed approach (Spearman correlation matrix and Chi-Square independence test)
* Performed feature selection via Extra Trees algorithm
* **Keywords**: Marketing, Predictive modelling, Outlier detection, Feature selection, Hybrid Gradient Boosting
